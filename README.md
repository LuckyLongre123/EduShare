# 🎓 EduShare - Educational Notes Sharing Platform

## 📋 Project Overview

**EduShare** is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to facilitate seamless sharing of educational materials between students and teachers across different colleges and departments. This project addresses the common problem of limited access to quality study materials by creating a centralized repository where academic resources can be uploaded, browsed, and downloaded by the educational community.

### 🎯 Problem Statement
Students often struggle to find quality notes and study materials for their courses. Traditional methods of sharing notes are limited to physical copies or informal digital sharing, which lacks organization, searchability, and quality control.

### 💡 Solution
EduShare provides a structured, user-friendly platform where:
- Students and teachers can upload their notes and study materials
- Users can browse and search for materials by subject, semester, college, and tags
- An admin approval system ensures quality control
- Interactive features like likes and comments foster community engagement
